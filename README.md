**INTRODUCTION**

This repository contains some models of dynamic rigid surfaces (DRS) that can serve as dynamic locomotion environments for simulating controller performance in real-world DRS locomotion. The "DRS_Motek_treadmill" files emulate the rocking and sliding motion of the Motek treadmill, while "DRS_VerticalMotion" includes a prismatic joint along the vertical axis to simulate vertical motion. These platforms have been utilized by our team to evaluate the performance of legged locomotion controllers on DRS.

To load a DRS model in PyBullet (https://pypi.org/project/pybullet/), install PyBullet using the pip command (*pip install pybullet*) and run any of the Python scripts (*drs_treadmill.py* or *drs_vertical.py*).
